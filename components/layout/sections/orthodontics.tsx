              Orthodontics is the treatment of irregularities in the teeth and
              jaws. Orthodontic care involves the use of devices such as braces
              to straighten teeth and correct problems with bite.

              What is the difference between Orthodontists and Dentists?

            <p className="mb-8 text-base sm:text-lg">
              Orthodontists specialise in aligning teeth and jaws, while Dentists
              help patients achieve a cleaner, healthier smile through cleanings,
              x-ray and even surgery.

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg">
              An orthodontist is a dentist trained to diagnose, prevent, and
              treat teeth and jaw irregularities. They correct existing conditions
              and are trained to identify problems that may develop in the
              future. Orthodontists work with people of all ages, from children
              to adults.

            <p className="mb-4 text-base sm:text-lg">
              Orthodontists use fixed and removable dental devices, like braces,
              retainers, and bands, to change the position of teeth in the mouth. They
              treat dental abnormalities, including:

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-base sm:text-lg">
              <li>Crooked teeth</li>
              <li>Bite problems, like an over-bite or an under-bite</li>
              <li>Crowded teeth, or teeth that are too far apart</li>
              <li>Jaw misalignment</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg">
              The goal of orthodontic care is to improve a patient&rsquo;s bite. Teeth that
              are straight and evenly spaced will align with opposing teeth in the jaw.
              A healthy bite ensures you can eat, chew, and speak properly. In the
              past, seeing an orthodontist was associated with children or teenagers
              who needed braces. However, orthodontists can correct dental
              problems at any age.
