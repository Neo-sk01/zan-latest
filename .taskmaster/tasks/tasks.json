Apply Tailwind CSS responsive classes:\n   - Replace fixed dimensions with responsive utilities (w-full, max-w-screen-*)\n   - Implement fluid typography using text-* classes with responsive modifiers\n   - Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:) for breakpoint-specific styling\n   - Apply flex and grid layouts with responsive modifiers for adaptive content organization\n\n3. Fix layout and text issues:\n   - Adjust container padding and margins for smaller screens\n   - Implement proper text wrapping and truncation where needed\n   - Create mobile-specific navigation components (hamburger menu)\n   - Ensure proper spacing between elements at all breakpoints\n\n4. Optimize images and media:\n   - Implement responsive image techniques using Tailwind's object-fit utilities\n   - Consider using the picture element for art direction\n   - Ensure proper loading and display of media across devices\n\n5. Test and refine:\n   - Iteratively test on multiple device sizes and orientations\n   - Address edge cases like extremely small screens or landscape orientations\n   - Ensure touch targets are appropriately sized (min 44x44px) for mobile users\n\nImplementation should follow a mobile-first approach, starting with the smallest viewport and progressively enhancing for larger screens.",

Manual Testing:\n   - Test on actual physical devices (not just browser emulation):\n     * iOS devices: iPhone SE, iPhone 12/13/14, iPad\n     * Android devices: Small phone (Galaxy S), Large phone (Pixel), Tablet\n   - Test in both portrait and landscape orientations\n   - Verify touch interactions work properly on mobile devices\n   - Check for any text overlapping, overflow issues, or horizontal scrolling\n\n3. Cross-Browser Testing:\n   - Verify responsive behavior in Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge\n   - Pay special attention to iOS Safari which may have unique rendering behaviors\n\n4. Accessibility Testing:\n   - Ensure the responsive design maintains accessibility at all viewport sizes\n   - Verify that text remains readable (minimum 16px font size on mobile)\n   - Check that interactive elements maintain proper focus states\n\n5. Performance Testing:\n   - Measure and compare page load times across different devices\n   - Verify that responsive images load appropriately for the device\n   - Run Lighthouse mobile performance audits\n\n6.

Responsive Testing Tools:\n   - Use Responsively App to simultaneously view multiple device sizes\n   - Employ Chrome DevTools Device Mode for rapid testing\n   - Utilize BrowserStack for testing on devices not physically available\n\n3. Validation Checklist:\n   - Confirm no horizontal scrolling appears on any screen size\n   - Verify all text is readable without zooming\n   - Ensure all interactive elements have appropriate touch target sizes\n   - Check that images scale properly without distortion\n   - Validate that spacing remains consistent and appropriate across breakpoints\n\n4. User Flow Testing:\n   - Complete key user journeys on mobile devices\n   - Verify that functionality works correctly at all breakpoints\n   - Test orientation changes (portrait/landscape)\n\n5.
